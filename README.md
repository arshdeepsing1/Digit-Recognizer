# Handwritten Digits Recognition: A Comprehensive Analysis

This project implements and analyse state-of-the-art machine learning models which are quite popular in the Data Science community. The project aims to utilize key aspects of data science to a real world problem of analysing handwritten digit images. The approach to implement the project was to first execute Exploratory Data Analysis of the data. The EDA of the MNIST revealed how different machine learning models will behave on this dataset. It was followed by experimental analysis of the dataset by implementing six different algorithms and comparing them on the basis of test accuracy metric and test error metric.
